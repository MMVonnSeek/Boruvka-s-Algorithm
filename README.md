Boruvka’s Algorithm in Python

We will learn how to code Boruvka’s Algorithm in Python. Algorithms are at the heart of computer science. They are expressed as a finite sequence of operations with well-defined input and output. Boruvka’s approach works by starting with nodes from the input network and growing that forest by adding minimal-weight edges from between its linked components until it becomes a minimum spanning tree of the input graph. Boruvka’s technique has the benefit of not requiring sophisticated data structures to achieve the time complexity constraint. In addition, we are implementing Boruvka’s Algorithm in the Python programming language.
